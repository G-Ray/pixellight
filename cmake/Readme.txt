This directory contains our CMake framework that is used to build PixelLight itself.

If you're looking for information on how to build PixelLight, have a look at 'BUILD' in the root directory of this
source tree.

If you're looking for a CMake script to use PixelLight in other projects, have a look at 'PLSDK/CMake' which contains
a FindPixelLight script for CMake.

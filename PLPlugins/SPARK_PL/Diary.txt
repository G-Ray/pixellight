- Ok, I think the plugin is now ready for the public Git-repository, although I still have to think about how the plugin can/should be used. The
  main work was writing the renderer implementations. Currently I just added some scene nodes which are actually ports of some SPARK demos. Possibly,
  it's a good idea to provide some "standard particle effect scene nodes" like a fire were the user can just adjust some RTTI attributes + it should
  also be possible to directly use the SPARK interface so that this plugin doesn't take away the freedom to do everything one may do with SPARK.

- Finally, found some time (there was some left under the carpet) to continue the work on the SPARK-plugin. I can now already see particles flying
  around. I really like SPARK because it's well designed.

- Started the "SPARK_PL"-project. This project integrates the free open source particle engine "SPARK" (http://spark.developpez.com) into PixelLight as a
  plugin. Within the SPARK SDK, there are some plugins for integration like Irrlicht ("SPARK_IRR") or SFML ("SPARK_SFML"), so I named this new project
  "SPARK_PL". For now, I decided to link SPARK statically because the lib is quite compact and so, this PixelLight plugin doesn't need additional
  external dependencies (but it may be changed to dynamically linked later if required/wished).

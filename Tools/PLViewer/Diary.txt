- When loading a resource, the viewer now tries to activate the color gradient background within the scene renderer
  -> The standard scene renderer compositions of PixelLight within "Standard.zip" always have an inactive "PLCompositing::SRPBackgroundColorGradient"-instance
  -> By using a color gradient background, also completely black/gray/white etc. meshes can be seen which is a good thing as a default setting within this viewer

- Show the user a native filename within the GUI
- Beside "Scene" and "Script", "PLViewer" is now also able to load in "Mesh", "Material" and "Image" (= texture)
- "Application::LoadResource()": The resource loading is tricky, and every solution will end up in being a hack due to lack of information.
  Within materials, meshes etc. there are usually relative paths provided, no absolute (not just true for PixelLight file formats).
  Further, those paths are usually relative to a project root resulting e.g. within a default directory layout like
  - Root
    - Data
      - Meshes
      - Materials
  For "normal" projects this is no issue because everything is usually relative to the root project directory...
  ... but this viewer must be able to pick out e.g. a mesh out of nowhere and must still be able to locate the required
  other resources like materials. So, in here, we can only work with heuristics... this can and will of course go from
  time to time horribly wrong...
PLViewerQt:
- Redraw & ping the frontend so the GUI stays kind-of responsive while loading, but disable the Qt main window while loading so the user can't prank around within
  the GUI
- Show the user some loading progress
- Added GUI menu entry to make it possible to open the log file

- Removed "PLViewerStandalone"-variation, while still maintaining the feature it introduced. This means that in the future I also no longer have to explain what
  "PLViewerStandalone" is for (see diary entry "21.08.2010"). "PLViewerStandalone" was just "PLViewer" compiled with a set "STANDALONE" preprocessor definition
  resulting that the log and configuration file are in the same directory as this executable instead of within the users directory were applications nowadays have
  to put those stuff into.
  -> In case the file "PLViewer.cfg" is in the same directory as the executable, or within one directory "above" (e.g. because there are "x86" and "x64" versions)
     run this application in "standalone-mode"
  -> When shipping something by using PLViewer, experience tells that there's always such a file provided to set the desired settings, so, this is no drawback
     and this enables us to provide just one version of this executable
PLViewerQt:
- Removed "PLViewerQtStandalone"-variation
- "PLViewerQt" is now reusing as much as possible from "PLViewer" and is "just" adding a lightweight GUI-layer

PLViewerQt:
- Added a menu bar entry which makes it possible to select the currently used camera
- Added a menu bar entry which makes it possible to create new dockable widgets. This is currently still under construction, but shows that the RTTI dock
  widget concept is working quite well. See PLFrontendQt entry within the PLCore diary for details.

PLViewerQt:
- Started "PLViewerQt"-project with the goal to provide a more sophisticated generic PixelLight viewer application. PLViewer will not be removed because a
  minimalistic PixelLight viewer supporting scenes and scripts is still useful.
  Since the first public release of PixelLight there are the following points on the roadmap at http://www.pixellight.org/site/index.php/page/20.html
  - "Make PLViewer a more universal viewer also capable of viewing all kind of data (e.g. texture and meshes)"
  - "Create a nice UI for PLViewer (ingame GUI)"
  While those are quite important points, no one realized them... because this will be useful for my Master Thesis I'll now start the project instead of
  writing an own GUI for my Master Thesis. Over a year ago it was planned to create the GUI by using PLGui, which would have been cool... sadly since then
  no one had worked on PLGui. Although it has a really good design, PLGui is currently in no shape to be used in a more GUI intensive project without
  spending days in just implementing general GUI features. This approach was taken in some other projects, the results were good, but it was time consuming
  to archive the result. Right now I can't afford to spend days on just working on reimplementing GUI features e.g. Qt offers, and still having only poor and
  buggy result and issues across multiple platforms.
  So, the only reasonable option left appears to be using Qt for a more sophisticated generic PixelLight viewer application. Stephan Wezel already
  added "PLFrontendQt" which is a Qt<->PL adapter project. This project already offers several generic GUI elements like an RTTI inspector. I'am going to
  use "PLFrontendQt" for "PLViewerQt" and put everything reasonable in "PLFrontendQt" so that "PLViewerQt" can be as compact as possible, while still offering
  advanced features.
  On "10.08.2011" Stephan and I started "PLEditor" because there were questions from the community when such an editor will come. Goal was to make a start and
  motivate other people to jump onto the editor train. While people are interested in such a tool, it appears that no one is interested in helping to realize
  it. Stephan and I can't create a descend editor on our own while working on such a mammoth project as PixelLight itself. There are now some new PixelLight team
  members, but everybody has only a limited amount of time and they are still in the processes of getting experienced with the technology. When "PLViewerQt" is
  up and running, maybe it will show other persons how cool such an editor would be and that it's nothing overcomplicated from a programmers point of view... a
  lot of PixelLight implementation details are far more complex.
  Enough project opening speech. The goal is simple: Provide a generic PixelLight viewer with rudimentary edit features via GUI so it's for example possible to
  manipulate RTTI attributes of a scene node and be able to see the effect on the screen at once. Goal isn't to create a fully featured editor - that's what
  the editor project is for. I'am trying to keep the "core" of this viewer as close possible the viewer not using Qt to make it possible to see the Qt relevant part
  at once. Meaning I'am e.g. not using "main" etc. as usually done within Qt based applications.
- Started the GUI implementation
- Implemented "Gui::QtSlotLoad()" by using "PLFrontendQt::ConstructFileFilter" to automatically fill the file filters with the supported file formats
- Ensured that the new "PLViewerQt" is compiling and running under Linux as well

- Instead of the base directory, the viewer now sets directly the current directory (the viewer is an executable application, not a library, so this should be ok)



>> 06.11.2011

- "Application::LoadScene()": In case there's no "/Data/Scenes/" within the scene filename, the directory the scene is in is used as base directory instead



>> 21.08.2011
[CO]
- PLViewer is no longer closing at once when not provided with the filename of the scene/script to load in, or the loading failed
- PLViewer is now misusing the frontend title to communicate with the user *scrooge approach*



>> 15.08.2011

- The PLViewer application is now directly within the tools executable directory. The purpose of PLViewer is to have a minimalistic and generic
  viewer application - but this application shouldn't e.g. require any own data in order to be able to run. For more than just viewing something,
  the planned PixelLight editor should do the job (one bigger decent tool instead of many small programs).



>> 31.07.2011

- The PLViewer application is now using PLInput instead of PLGui to get and process input events



>> 13.06.2011

- "MultiUser" Komandozeilen Parameter hinzugefügt, darüber lässt sich von außen Einstellen ob z.B. Log & Config direkt bei
  der exe liegen sollen, oder sauber im User-Verzeichnis. Für "Standalone"-Szenen die man packen und schnell mal so mit PLViewer
  weitergeben will ist das recht Praktisch. Diesen Parameter werte ich momentan in "Application::OnInitLog()" und nicht in
  "Application::OnInitCmdLine()" aus damit sich dieser Parameter auch auf das Log auswirkt.

- Bugfix: Basispfad "" sollte nicht entfernt werden -> Dies ist das aktuelle Verzeichnis, das normalerweise direkt das Verzeichnis
  ist in dem die exe liegt... so können z.B. noch PLViewer Daten geladen werden

- "PLSceneViewer" aus PLSamples nach PLTools verschoben und in "PLViewer" umbenannt. Zukünftig wird dieses kleine Tool nicht
  nur Szenen, sondern auch Texturen etc. Anzeigen können.

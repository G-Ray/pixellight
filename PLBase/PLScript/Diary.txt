- Compiled 32 bit versions of Lua, Python and V8 (JavaScript engine) for Windows and Linux. Configurated everything so that the script
  projects can be compiled and are able to run.
  Next stop: Concrete script implementations :D

- Started the PLScript project. As usual there's a null backend and I'll implement backends for Lua, JavaScript and Python in parallel.

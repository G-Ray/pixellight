- AngelScript backend: Implemented "AddDynamicFunction()" and "RemoveAllDynamicFunctions()"



>> 30.04.2011
[CO]
- Added script support for functors/functoids so that it's possible to call C++ functions or member methods from inside scripts...
  as well as other script functions because the functors are hiding this detail.
  The method "Script::AddDynamicFunction()" is used to register functors while "Script::RemoveAllDynamicFunctions()" can be used to remove
  all registerd functors. The Lua implementation is already working. Please note that this is still highly experimental and I don't know
  whether or not the script interfaces are completly changed later.



>> 29.04.2011
[CO]
- Added "GetScriptLanguage()", "GetSourceCode()" and "SetSourceCode()" to "Script" (similar to "PLRenderer::Shader")
- Added "FuncScriptPtr" which is a version of "PLCore::FuncFunPtr"/"PLCore::FuncMemPtr" for script functions. This means that script functions
  can be called in the same way as all other functions/methods (e.g. RTTI methods) can be called. This template is using
  the "Script" methods "BeginCall()", "PushArgument()", "EndCall()" and "GetReturn()" to call script functions. Calling Lua and AngelScript
  functions is already implemented and working. Those mentioned script function calling methods are currently public although it's not recommended
  to call them without using "FuncScriptPtr", but currently I see no change to hide those methods from the user. But this is just my first attempt to
  get things up and running... next stop: Implementing the same for Python and JavaScript. (calling C/C++ methods from scripts will follow as well)
- Calling JavaScript functions is working... although the implementation is currently somewhat poor... having some issues getting into the V8-API...

- As requested within the PixelLight forum at: http://dev.pixellight.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=45
  ... I'll also added a script backend for AngelScript (like the others, just a skeleton right now!). Ok, four script languages should really
  be enough to get a good script interface.

- Compiled 32 bit versions of Lua, Python and V8 (JavaScript engine) for Windows and Linux. Configurated everything so that the script
  projects can be compiled and are able to run.
  Next stop: Concrete script implementations :D

[CO]
- Started the PLScript project. As usual there's a null backend and I'll implement backends for Lua, JavaScript and Python in parallel.

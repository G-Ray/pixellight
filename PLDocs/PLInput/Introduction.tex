\paragraph{Motivation}
The PixelLight input component provides access and control over several input devices. Although the purpose of this project is to have an input library that perfectly integrates into the PixelLight framework, \emph{PLInput} can be used without other PixelLight components like the rendering system as well.




\section{External Dependences}
The core of PLInput depends on the \textbf{PLGeneral}, \textbf{PLCore} and \textbf{PLMath} libraries. PLInput is using some platform dependent third party libraries, but usually, the resulting binary of PLInput library is stand alone and does not force you to deliver additional shared libraries, too.


\paragraph{Microsoft Windows}
When compiling for \emph{Microsoft Windows}, there are no additional external dependencies - the few required \emph{hid.dll} system shared library functions are loaded dynamically.

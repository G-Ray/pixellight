\subsection{Overview}
This LaTeX framework is designed to provide a simple to use environment for creating LaTeX files
that gets rid of some of the typical LaTeX drawbacks, e.g. typing multiple lines of text inside
a colored box while still being able to use verbatim environments :-)\\
It was adjusted to produce the desired output on dvi, pdf and html by using the following
systems: LaTeX, dvipdfm and tex4ht.

The framework contains of several parts:
\begin{description}
\item[TeX:]
A set of useful functions that are easy to work with. You should install the .sty file
in your local texmf directory
\item[Skeleton:]
A base document skeleton you can use when creating a new LaTeX document. The files are
well structured and the new functions are used automatically, in addition a shell
script is included for the creation of several output formats (dvi, pdf, html)
\item[Sample:]
A sample file demonstrating the use of the framework and the new commands

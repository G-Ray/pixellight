\chapter{Introduction}


\paragraph{Motivation}
The reason for creating \emph{PLScript} was to have a minimalistic and universal interface to work with script languages. Instead of implementing an own script system we use a backend design pattern to use already available common implementations like \emph{JavaScript}.


\section{External Dependences}
PLScript only depends on the \textbf{PLGeneral} and \textbf{PLCore} libraries and doesn't use any external third party libraries itself.

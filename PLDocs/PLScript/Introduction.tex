\paragraph{Motivation}
The reason for creating the script interface was to have a minimalistic and universal interface to work with script languages. Instead of implementing an own script system we use a backend design pattern to use already available common implementations like \emph{JavaScript}.


\section{External Dependences}
There's no individual \emph{PLScript} project, it's part of \emph{PLCore}. \emph{PLCore} only depends on the \textbf{PLGeneral} library and doesn't use any external third party libraries itself.

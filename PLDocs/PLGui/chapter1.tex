\section{Overview}
PLGui is a highly flexible and portable GUI (graphical user interface) library that comes with a strictly object oriented API for the C++ language. It allows the creation of graphical user interfaces in an platform independent way while providing advanced features (docking windows, look\&feel, etc.) that work similar on every platform.

Once it is designed with the PLGui API, the same GUI can be used on every supported platform just by changing the backend for PLGui. It is even possible to use more than one PLGui backend at one time, e.g. one native backend (Microsoft Windows/Linux) for the application framework and a backend for ingame menus.

The PLGui library provides the common GUI elements (windows, dialogs, menus, etc.) and has a great number of controls and common dialogs that can be used. In addition to this it is easy to create own windows or controls that have a custom design and behaviour and can even make use of advanced features.

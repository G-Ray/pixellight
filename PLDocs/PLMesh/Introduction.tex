\paragraph{Motivation}
While the \emph{PLRenderer} component provides basic rendering features, one usually does not want to draw each and every triangle by hand. The purpose of \emph{PLMesh} is to add features to deal with more complex meshes in a comfortable way - the most simple one would be to just load in an already existing mesh and rendering it. The automatic creation of meshes like boxes, spheres and so on as well as mesh animation is also part of this library.




\section{External Dependences}
PLMesh depends on the \textbf{PLGeneral}, \textbf{PLCore}, \textbf{PLMath}, \textbf{PLGraphics} and \textbf{PLRenderer} libraries.

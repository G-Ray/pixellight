\section{PLGeneral}


\subsection{Text processing}
\begin{itemize}
\item{An advanced dynamic string class with ASCII, Unicode and UTF-8 support + extensive UTF-8 tool class}
\item{An advanced tokenizer which allows you to parse texts without any effort}
\item{XML classes (DOM) making it comfortable to load, edit and save XML files}
\item{Regular expression class\footnote{Internally PCRE (\url{http://www.pcre.org/}) is used}}
\item{Extensive command line parser}
\item{Static adapter class for mapping Qt\footnote{Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework, \url{http://qt.nokia.com/}} strings to PixelLight strings and vice versa}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{System}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Multi threading functionality (thread, semaphore, mutex)}
\item{Dynamic/shared libraries}
\item{Pipes}
\item{Class for comfortable processes interaction}
\item{Easy access to system information like used OS, user name, available memory, etc.}
\item{Access to environment variables}
\item{Basic OS console functions}
\item{Class for working with the registry (if the OS has one)}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Network}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Basic universal standard network functionality like sockets}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{File system}
\begin{itemize}
\item{File class for access to standard OS files, archives like zip\footnote{Internally zlib (\url{http://www.zlib.org/}) is used} and even http with password support and other special access settings}
\item{Quite universal design. For instance, it is possible to open a file within an archive from an http server.}
\item{Comfortable URL-class taking the pain when dealing with filenames, especially when you want to work platform independent}
\item{Access to the OS standard streams using the file class}
\item{File search functionality with filters (wildcard, regular expression)}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{A huge set of additional tools}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Log with flexible implementation so we can output into a file (unformatted text, XML, html) or into the console}
\item{Unified abstract checksum interface. (the SDK comes with a MD5, CRC32 and SHA-1 plugin) Supports checksum from string, memory or files.}
\item{General list interface with concrete implementations for linked list, array, bitset and so on}
\item{Many basic tool classes like stack, queue, hash map, heap, quick sort, singleton, iterator etc.}
\item{PixelLight comes with an efficient resource manager template system which is used by several managers, e.g. textures, meshes, sounds, paths, shaders etc. }
\item{PixelLight provides an advanced timing class which offers a lot of timing relevant functions. Time difference since the last frame with clamp functionality, past time since start, slow motion, pause, freeze, FPS limiter, stopwatch}
\item{Basic memory manager so you can mix release and debug builds as good as possible}
\end{itemize}




\section{PLCore}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Generic functor class\footnote{Delegate, a form of type-safe function pointer, 'callback'}}
\item{Event system\footnote{The principle is also known as signals \& slots}}
\item{RTTI and plugin system with support for delayed shared library loading to speed up the program start and to reduce memory consumption}
\item{Loadable system. Everything that can be loaded and saved is not limited to just one 'hacked in' file format. Hence, it is possible to add, for instance, a loader plugin for your own mesh or image file formats in a quite universal way!}
\item{Localization system}
\item{Configuration system}
\end{itemize}




\section{PLScript}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Generic script language independent script interface\footnote{The PixelLight SDK comes with Null and Lua (\url{http://www.lua.org/}) backends, within the repository are also experimental JavaScript (using V8, a ECMA-262 compliant JavaScript engine, see \url{http://code.google.com/p/v8/})), Python (\url{http://www.python.org/}) and AngelScript (\url{http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/}) backends.}}
\item{Supported script features are global variables, global functions\footnote{C++ calls script and script calls C++} and RTTI objects\footnote{Properties, attributes, methods, signals, slots}}
\item{Scripting is heavily using PLCore features like the RTTI, therefore adding script bindings or using RTTI objects within scripts is fairly straightforward and don't require the writing of thousands of proxy/wrapper classes exposing C++ functionality to script languages}
\item{Certain parts of PixelLight are exposed to script languages through the loose plugin \emph{PLScriptBindings}}
\item{Scripting is completely optional, not mandatory}
\end{itemize}




\section{PLDatabase}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Abstract unified database interfaces\footnote{The PixelLight SDK comes with Null and SQLite (\url{http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/}) backends, within the repository are also experimental MySQL (\url{http://www.mysql.com/}) and PostgreSQL (\url{http://www.postgresql.org/}) backends.}}
\end{itemize}




\section{PLGraphics}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Extensive image class which is able to load and save the image formats dds, png\footnote{Using libpng \url{http://www.libpng.org/}}, tga, jpg\footnote{Using libjpeg \url{http://www.ijg.org/}}, ppm and bmp by default. Further formats can be added without any effort.}
\item{Comfortable rgb and rgba color classes}
\end{itemize}




\section{PLMath}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Various comfortable and feature rich vector classes for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors}
\item{Easily usable 3x3, 3x4 and 4x4 matrices with also offers important functions, like converting a direction vector into a rotation matrix}
\item{Quaternions}
\item{Planes}
\item{Bounding box (AABB and OBB)}
\item{Advanced Euler angles conversion tool class (from/to rotation matrix, from/to quaternion -> and all for multiple axis orders)}
\item{Helper functions like transforming a 2D coordinate to an 3D and backward to, for example, find out were in the 3D world the 2D mouse cursor is in}
\end{itemize}

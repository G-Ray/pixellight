\chapter{Batching}
Do NOT create a scene which is in fact only one big object, but do also NOT create a object for each single triangle! The realtime performance of your scene depends heavy on the spatial separation. Within each cell, there should be single objects for the room geometry\footnote{ONE huge object for the room geometry is NOT recommended!} and the objects within this \emph{room}. If a cell is currently invisible, ALL objects within this cell are completely ignored. If a cell is visible, each object inside it is checked for visibility.

\textbf{Take care of batches! Group small static objects to one object but do NOT use one huge object for the \emph{room} geometry.}

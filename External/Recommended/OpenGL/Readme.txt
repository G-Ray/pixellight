- We're sorry, but due to legal issues we can't provide you with a downloadable package
- "gl.h" and "glu.h" normally come with your Compiler, and they are not always free to distribute

	- "External\_Windows_x86_32\OpenGL\include\GL"
		- "gl.h"
		- "glu.h"
- Here's what you need for the Linux platform and were to put the files:

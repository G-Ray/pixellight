[CO]
- Added empty project "PLQt". In the next steps, PLQt (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pixellight/) from Stephan Wezel will be integrated directly into the PixelLight
  Git repository and SDK because e.g. the editor will be Qt based. I currently use Qt 4.7.0 and I know that there's already a newer version available... but I already
  had Qt 4.7.0 compiled for VisualStudio 2010 (to avoid using VC 2008 within the PL SDK) a while ago and right now I don't want to spend time in recompiling Qt, again.
- Moved "QtStringAdapter" from PLGeneral into PLQt
- Integrated PLQt, I'am sure it's not yet final and that over time, there will be multiple simplifications

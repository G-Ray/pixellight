- Moved the out-of-date terrain and sky class from the core component "PLScene" into this loose plugin "PLNature". Those two classes
  are so old, that there's not even a diary entry with a date when it was added. So it's from around 2002 and has not been used or really
  maintained since then. Within the PixelLight forum, there are frequently questions about terrain... to be honest, it starts to get a
  little bit annoying because while there are questions about it, no one appears to willing to work on decent terrain, sky, cloud, vegetation
  and water rendering. Implementing and especially maintaining modern algorithms for these tasks are a task for a single person. I never used
  those components, don't need them right now and have to work on nearly everything on my own (there's already support for unit tests and some
  other parts by other persons, this is at least a beginning :) - so no chance that I can cover those thopic as well. At least not when it shouldn't
  look totally cheap and out-of-date, again.
  In order to hopefully reduce such questions and to make it easier for someone to get into it, I assume it's best to not have such components
  within the important and generic core project PLScene.
  - For cloud rendering: The following source of information looks promising: http://www.markmark.net/clouds/
  - In general, I assume PLNature has to offer multiple algorithms for every task... to be able to cover many platforms. While e.g. GPU tessellation
    would be suited to be used for terrain rendering, not every platform has the tessellation feature. Same for other tasks and other features. So,
    e.g. just throwing in any high map renderer will *not* to the job. This was suffucient 10 years ago, but nowadays it's not. There's a reason why
    I currently don't dare to touch those topics. There are engines and companies just working on those topics. We *really* have to split&share the work
    in order to get it done.

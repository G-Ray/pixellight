*  @section intro_sec Introduction
*
*  This is the PLPhysicsBullet reference. Some parts of the class documentation are taken from the
*  Bullet documentation. The plugin is no Bullet wrapper, it only offers plugins which will make your
*  work using PixelLight and Bullet more comfortable.
*
*  Newton uses the matrixes in row-major/left-handed order (this is the way DirectX stores matrices).
*  If you are using PL matrices (column-major/right-handed, like OpenGL does) you will need to transpose
*  the matrices into a local array, before you pass them to Newton.

- I assume that the volume renderer plugins contain enough in order to justify an own diary
  -> Within my master thesis, the focus was on rendering medical datasets. I tried to keep everything as generic as possible, so,
     adding support rendering volume data containing real color information should be easy. In principle, the volume renderer plugins
     can also be used to visualize general volumetric data, e.g. in order to debug a "Light Propagation Volumes"-implementation or to
     render volumetric special effects like clouds, fire, water and so on. The GPU volume raycaster is fully dynamic, meaning that the
     volume	data is free to change it's content frequently (by rendering to 3D texture or using OpenCL/CUDA).
- Updated copyright information to integrate it completely into the PixelLight Git repository
- In the first push to the Git repository I'll make, the CMake files are not integrated into the PixelLight Git repository, yet (do
  this within one of the following integration steps)
- I'll also add a downloadable volume rendering demo later on so one can get an idea what volume rendering is about easily
- Renamed PLLoaderDICOM_GDCM into PLVolumeLoaderDICOM_GDCM and PLLoaderPVM into PLVolumeLoaderPVM to make it clear that those plugins
  are PLVolume related

- Added the plugins PLLoaderDICOM_GDCM, PLLoaderPVM, PLVolume, PLVolumeRenderer and PLVolumeGui I wrote as part of my
  master thesis "Scalable Realtime Volume Rendering".
  -> The thesis can be downloaded at: http://ablazespace.sourceforge.net/as-page/projects/MasterThesis/Ofenberg2012.pdf (in German)
  -> See http://dev.pixellight.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=483#p1339 for more information as well as videos
  -> I also wrote PLLoaderDICOM_DCMTK but chanceled it during the thesis because DCMTK has no free JPEG 2000 codec
     (DCMJP2K - DICOM JPEG 2000 Module (http://dicom.offis.de/dcmjp2k.php.en - Is not part of the freeware distribution, must be
     licensed separately)
  -> Until now, these new plugins are only tested on MS Windows 32/64 bit
  -> Still need to to some minor PixelLight Git repository integration steps (updating the CMake files, copyright update etc.)
  -> Across the Internet, there are several good sources of free available volume data like "The Volume Library" at
     http://www9.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/External/vollib/
  -> In order to use the new volume rendering feature, just drag'n'drop a resource containing volume data (pvm, DICOM and a
     few other formats are supported) into PLViewerQt, done

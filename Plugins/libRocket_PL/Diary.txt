- Renamed "MessageFilterRocket" into "PLGuiMessageFilterRocket" and made the implementation inline so that the project itself doesn't depend on PLGui. One can
  use this offer in order to let PLGui easily interact with libRocket, but one can also use another GUI or general message system to feed libRocket.

- Added "libRocketAdapter"

- Implemented "Rocket::Core::FileInterface"
- libRocket is using UTF-8 encoding, took this into account within the implementation

- Implemented the rendering & system & interaction interfaces of libRocket... looks like libRocket is now running within PixelLight. WOW, this
  integration was somewhat too easy. :D
  Building the PL SDK with libRocket support using CMake is not tested yet, the Linux support is not yet tested either... but there's still some
  time until the next planned PL SDK release. *g*
- Tested it under Linux, "PLDemo_libRocket" starts but the window is positioned left top and the mouse cursor is limited to a small region of the window...
- In the Windows PL SDK, the libRocket stuff is now at the correct place

- Started the "libRocket_PL"-project. A few weeks ago, there was a discussion within the PL IRC chat room named #pixellight at the Efnet network
  (e.g. irc.prison.net, efnet.demon.co.uk, irc.inet.tele.dk, irc.isdnet.fr) about support for an alternative ingame GUI library within the PL SDK.
  This project integrates the free open source HTML/CSS game interface middleware "libRocket" (http://librocket.com/) into PixelLight. Please note
  that this project is NOT meant as a replacement of the PLGui ingame GUI system or PLGui itself! But as usual in PixelLight, the user has now a
  choice between multiple options.

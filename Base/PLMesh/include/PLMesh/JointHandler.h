		*    By default, joints are NOT user controlled which means their absolute translation

		*    states. This way, multiple 'offline' (predefined :) animations can be mixed together to get
		*    a final animation where animations can only influence some parts of the skeleton. If a
		*    joint is marked as 'used controlled', the animations system does not calculate the
		*    absolute values by itself. In this case, this joints can be fully 'online' (dynamic) animated
		*    by using for instance physics objects in the case of ragdoll animations. Normally only a
		*    few joints are user controlled while others are still updated automatically relative to
		*    their parents.

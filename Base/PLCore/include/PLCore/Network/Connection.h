/**
*  @brief
*    Connection base class
*
*  @remarks
*    This is the most important base class of the PLCore network classes for the 'concrete'
*    communication. This class 'only' offers low-level methods for the communication on a pure
*    abstract data layer, meaning sending of strings or data-arrays without known usage/semantic.
*    Derived connection classes have to implement the concrete content layer.
*    For example a chat-connection offers methods like SendMessage(), SendPrivateMessage(),
*    SlapUser(), defining in this way what the user can do within the network. Within this
*    methods a data-package is created and send by using Connection::Send(). In another usage
*    a game-connection may have something like SynchronizeObject(Object*), GetUpdate(),
*    SendAction(Action*).
*    In short, the task of the derived connection class is to define the concrete protocol
*    and to hide the rest so the application do not have to care about it. The application
*    should 'only' use the methods of the concrete for instance game-connection class - NEVER
*    creating somewhere data-packages and sending them by itself using Connection::Send()!

\chapter{PLScene}


\paragraph{Motivation}
The \emph{PLScene} component is the place were the magic happens. While high level libraries like \emph{PLMesh} already made the daily life easier, a single mesh usually is not enough for most applications. Real world applications need to deal with complete scenes consisting of tons of meshes as well as rendering them. This is were \emph{PLScene} comes in. The main component within \emph{PLScene} is the scene graph - the scene graph is an representation of the scene


\paragraph{External Dependences}
PLScene depends on the \textbf{PLCore}, \textbf{PLMath}, \textbf{PLGraphics}, \textbf{PLRenderer} and \textbf{PLMesh} libraries.

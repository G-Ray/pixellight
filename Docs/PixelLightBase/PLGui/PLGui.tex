\chapter{PLGui}


\paragraph{Motivation}
PLGui is a highly flexible and portable \ac{GUI} library that comes with a strictly object oriented \ac{API} for the C++ language. It allows the creation of graphical user interfaces in an platform independent way while providing advanced features (docking windows, look\&feel, etc.) that work similar on every platform.

Once it is designed with the PLGui \ac{API}, the same \ac{GUI} can be used on every supported platform just by changing the backend for PLGui. It is even possible to use more than one PLGui backend at one time, e.g. one native backend (Microsoft Windows/Linux) for the application framework and a backend for ingame menus.

The PLGui library provides the common \ac{GUI} elements (windows, dialogs, menus, etc.) and has a great number of controls and common dialogs that can be used. In addition to this it is easy to create own windows or controls that have a custom design and behaviour and can even make use of advanced features.


\paragraph{External Dependences}
PLGui depends on the \textbf{PLCore}, \textbf{PLMath} and \textbf{PLGraphics} libraries and doesn't use any external third party libraries.

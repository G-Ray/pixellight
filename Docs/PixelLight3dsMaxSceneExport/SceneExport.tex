\chapter{Scene Export}
Use \emph{File/Export} you can find in the \emph{Autodesk 3ds Max} menu bar to export all current objects etc. as one PixelLight scene. You can also select different objects and then using \emph{File/Export Selected} to export only the selected objects. This is recommended to avoid exporting undesired stuff. Now an dialog appears were you can setup different export options.

Note: After export, the nodes are relative to the container they are in and coordinate transformations may be performed. So, the exported position values are NOT always the same position values as in \emph{Autodesk 3ds Max}!

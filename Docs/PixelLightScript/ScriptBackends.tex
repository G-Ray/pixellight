\chapter{Script Backends}
This chapter deals with the different script backends shipping with the PixelLight \ac{SDK}.


\paragraph{Null}
\begin{itemize}
\item PixelLight component name: PLScriptNull
\item Used \ac{DLL}s: PLScriptNull.dll
\item The null script backend does nothing
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Lua}
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the preferred script plugin of the PixelLight team because Lua\footnote{Lua can be downloaded from \url{http://www.lua.org/}} is really easy to use, lightweight and fast. Also the community is very active.
\item Lua 5.1.4 backend
\item PixelLight component name: PLScriptLua
\item Used \ac{DLL}s: \emph{PLScriptLua.dll} and \emph{lua51.dll}
\end{itemize}

Here's a list of some links with useful Lua information:
\begin{itemize}
\item There's a really useful \emph{Lua reference card for Lua 5.1}\footnote{\url{http://thomaslauer.com/download/luarefv51.pdf} - Lua reference card for Lua 5.1} on Thomas Lauer's website at \url{http://thomaslauer.com/comp/Lua_Short_Reference}
\item \emph{Object Orientation Closure Approach} can be found at \url{http://lua-users.org/wiki/ObjectOrientationClosureApproach}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{AngelScript}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently not within the official PixelLight \ac{SDK}
\item AngelScript 2.20.2 backend\footnote{AngelScript can be downloaded from \url{http://www.angelcode.com/angelscript/}}
\item PixelLight component name: PLScriptAngelScript
\item Used \ac{DLL}s: \emph{PLScriptAngelScript.dll} and \emph{angelscript.dll}
\end{itemize}

Here's a list of some general notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item It looks like that AngelScript (2.20.2) has currently no support for namespaces... so right now, an ugly hack is used: e.g. \emph{PL.Timing.GetTimeDifference()} is written within scripts as \emph{PL\_Timing\_GetTimeDifference()}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{V8 (ECMA-262 compliant JavaScript engine)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently not within the official PixelLight \ac{SDK}
\item V8 JavaScript engine 3.3.1 backend\footnote{V8 JavaScript engine can be downloaded from \url{http://code.google.com/p/v8/}}
\item PixelLight component name: PLScriptV8
\item Used \ac{DLL}s: \emph{PLScriptV8.dll} and \emph{v8.dll}
\end{itemize}

Here's a list of some links with useful JavaScript information:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript} by Mike Koss  can be found at \url{http://mckoss.com/jscript/object.htm}
\item \emph{Private Members in JavaScript} by Douglas Crockford can be found at \url{http://javascript.crockford.com/private.html}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Python}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently not within the official PixelLight \ac{SDK}
\item Python 2.7.1 backend\footnote{Python can be downloaded from \url{http://www.python.org/}}
\item PixelLight component name: PLScriptPython
\item Used \ac{DLL}s: \emph{PLScriptPython.dll} and \emph{python27.dll}
\end{itemize}

Here's a list of some general notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently when using namespaces, an ugly hack is used: e.g. \emph{PL.Timing.GetTimeDifference()} is written within scripts as \emph{PL['Timing']['GetTimeDifference']()}
\end{itemize}

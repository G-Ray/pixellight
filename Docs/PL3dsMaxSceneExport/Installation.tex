\chapter{Installation}
Copy the plugin \emph{PL3dsMaxSceneExport\_2008.dle}\footnote{\emph{dle} = Scene Export Plug-In} into your \emph{Autodesk 3ds Max} plugin directory.\footnote{For instance \emph{c:/Programs/Autodesk/3ds Max 2008/plugins}} That's all! Now you can export scenes using the \emph{Autodesk 3ds Max} export options. \emph{\_2008} means this plugin is for \emph{Autodesk 3ds Max 2008}.

When updating the scene exporter and problems occur, it may be a good idea to remove the \emph{PixelLight\_SceneExporterSettings.ini} configuration within the \emph{Autodesk 3ds Max} plugin configuration directory.

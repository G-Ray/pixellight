\item{PLGui is an universal library that offers many functions for creating editors, etc. The framework itself also uses this GUI for its own 'ingame' dialogs.}
\item{The PLGui library provides simple classes for creating standard UI applications (using windows, dialogs etc.) and is designed to easily integrate PixelLight rendering into those programs. But you can also use other UI libraries and integrate PixelLight rendering into them if you wish (e.g. MFC or Qt)}

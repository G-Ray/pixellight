\paragraph{Motivation}
The reason for creating \emph{PLDatabase} was to have a minimalistic and universal interface to work with databases. Instead of implementing an own database system we use a backend design pattern to use already available common implementations like \emph{SQLite}.


\section{External Dependences}
PLDatabase only depends on the \textbf{PLGeneral} and \textbf{PLCore} libraries and doesn't use any external third party libraries itself.

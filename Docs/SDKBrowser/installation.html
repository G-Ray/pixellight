<div style="text-align: center;">
<h1>Installation</h1>



<br>



<h2>General</h2>



<div style="text-align: left;">It is highly recommended to
use the
provided installer to install the PixelLight SDK on your system. The
installer will add the PixelLight <span style="font-weight: bold;">'<a href="javascript:Dir_Runtime.Click()">Runtime</a>'</span>
path to the &#8217;PATH&#8217; environment variable of Windows. This is required to
enable Windows to find the different PixelLight dll&#8217;s and therefore to
use the PixelLight SDK in the proper way. If the PixelLight runtime
is registered, it is not required to copy the PixelLight dll&#8217;s into each of your
project directories - and therefore you can ensure that ALL of your projects in
development will always use the same and up to date PixelLight version.
This will avoid an unproductive version chaos.<br>



<br>



The
installer also adds a key to the
registry, so that the path to the installed SDK can be found
during runtime. This key is normally found at <span style="font-weight: bold;">'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PixelLight\PixelLight-SDK\Runtime'</span>
 (or within <span style="font-weight: bold;">'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\PixelLight\PixelLight-SDK\Runtime'</span> if you are using a 32 bit PixelLight SDK on a 64 bit Windows)
<br><br>



<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Note that it is
IMPORTANT that there&#8217;s only ONE installed </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">PixelLight</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> SDK! If there are multiple
PixelLight SDK&#8217;s, there will be conflicts because Windows can&#8217;t know
which of
the 3 for instance PLCore.dll versions is the correct one for your
task.</span><br>



</div>



<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>PixelLight runtime
directory</h2>



<div style="text-align: left;"> PixelLight requires some standard data that you will find in the PixelLight SDK
directory <span style="font-weight: bold;">'<a href="javascript:Dir_Runtime.Click()">Runtime</a>'</span>.
Within the package <span style="font-weight: bold;">'Runtime/Data/Standard.zip'</span>
are all default textures, texts etc. that are required by the framework. Within the '<a href="javascript:Dir_Runtime.Click()"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Runtime</span></a>'-directory
itself you will find all dll&#8217;s which a PixelLight program will need to
run. Note that all applications in the PixelLight SDK will use the data
directly from this directory and therefore the data and dll&#8217;s are not
duplicated, which will ensure that you always use the current versions. If
you want to publish your application, you have to copy this data into
your project directory to ensure that the user will have all required
files! Set <span style="font-weight: bold;">'*application name*.cfg ->
UsePixelLightRuntime'</span> you can find within your project
executable directory to '0' to ensure that there are no conflicts with
a PixelLight SDK installed on another system.<br>



</div>



<br>



<div style="text-align: left;"> Not ALL dll&#8217;s need to be
copied into your release package. For instance do NOT publish the debug
versions (normally with &#8217;D&#8217; at the end of the name like 'PLMathD.dll'). 
Only release the release versions. Note that you should not
copy unused files into your release project directory - that would only
be a waste of resources. If you don&#8217;t need certain plugins/backends you
can also ignore them during coping.<br>



<br>



</div>



<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Examples:</span><br>



<div style="text-align: left;">- If no 'Null'-renderer is
required ignore: PLRendererNull.plugin and PLRendererNull.dll<br>- If no 'ODE'-physics
plugin is required ignore: PLPhysicsODE.plugin, PLPhysicsODE.dll and ode.dll<br><br>
As you
see, PixelLight is extremely modular and various provided components
can be ignored. Each PixelLight plugin comes with a 'plugin'-file.
Within this file you can for example see the external references of the
plugin.<br><br>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Do NOT force the end user of your application to install a PixelLight SDK in order
be able to run your application. Do always make a release that contains everything the user will need to be able to run
your application out of the box without the need to install further software!</span><br>

</div>



<br>



<br>



<br>



<h2>Windows path variable</h2>



<div style="text-align: left;"> The&nbsp;PixelLight
SDK will automatically add the <span style="font-weight: bold;">'<a href="javascript:Dir_Runtime.Click()">Runtime</a>'</span>-path
to your Windows path variable if you have installed it correctly.
That is required if the&nbsp;PixelLight dll&#8217;s are not in the same
directory as the
executables! Therefore Windows will know where to look for the required
dlls.<br>

<br>



You are also able to edit this Windows path
variable by hand:<br>



1. Right click on the &#8217;My Computer&#8217; icon on
the desktop.<br>



2. Click on the &#8217;Advanced&#8217; tab.<br>



3.
Click the &#8217;Environment Variables&#8217; Button<br>



4. Under the &#8217;User Variables&#8217; header, select the PATH entry and click
&#8217;Edit&#8217;<br>



5.
Scroll to the end of the text, add a new semi-colon and
enter the location of your PixelLight runtime directory. (for example
'c:\PixelLight-SDK\Runtime\')<br>



6. Click &#8217;Ok&#8217; on all the panels to exit this dialog.<br>



<br>

<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">After the path variable of Windows was manipulated, you may need to restart our system! 
Whether or not a system restart is requires depends on various factors like OS version.</span><br>

<br>



<br>



<div style="text-align: left;">
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Microsoft Visual Studio</h2>



You have to give your development environment the correct directories where to find the
PixelLight relevant data: In your programming development environment like Microsoft Visual Studio you have to
setup these things:<br>



<ul>



  <li> <a href="javascript:Dir_Include.Click()"> <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Include
files</span></a>: Here you have to add the&nbsp;PixelLight include
directory <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8217;&lt;YourSDKPath&gt;/Include/&#8217;</span>
to enable the tool to find the headers etc. automatically. (for
instance
if you include #include &lt;PLCore/String/String.h&gt;)</li>



</ul>



<ul>



  <li> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <a href="javascript:Dir_Lib.Click()"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Library files</span></a></span>:
Where to find the libraries. Like the dll&#8217;s itself all libraries are
all in one directory <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8217;&lt;YourSDKPath&gt;/Lib/&#8217;</span>.
In Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 you will find this global options under: Menu -&gt; Tools
-&gt; Options -&gt; Projects -&gt;
VC++ directories. You can also set this paths per project.<br>



  </li>



</ul>

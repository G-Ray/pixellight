<h1>Introduction</h1>

<br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: left;">This
documentation, focused on the Windows platform, will give you an
overview over the&nbsp;PixelLight
SDK. For more detailed information about the various parts have a look at the
different documentations located in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8217;<a href="javascript:Dir_Docs.Click()">Docs</a>&#8217;</span>-directory.<br>

<br>
The PixelLight API is a strictly object-oriented API which offers
efficient interfaces to the different functions. Therefore it is useful
to have experience in object orient programming (OOP) to understand all
used techniques and be able to use its full power... but you can also
create simple programs if you are new to OOP or even programming in
general - in this case the documentation and the example programs will
show you how to develop your own first PixelLight project step by step.
Normally, there is no need for low level access in order to develop a
project, but it is still possible to do various things yourself.
Therefore the PixelLight API is extremely flexible, as it offers high
level functionality for efficient production, but still lets you do to
things yourself to avoid being limited by the framework's
functionality. Furthermore, the framework is easily expandable through
its unique and flexible runtime type information system (RTTI).
It is strongly recommended that you don't modify the framework source
code and headers, because this can lead to problems if there are new
framework versions. Instead, you should contact us in order to work out
whether an implementation is possible in a certain time frame. Moreover,
it would be nice if you inform us if you find some bugs or mistakes
within the framework documentation - in most cases these problems can
be solved quite easily.

<h2>SDK version number</h2>

<div style="text-align: left;">This is how the version
number of the SDK is constructed:<br>
<br>

PixelLight-SDK-<b>&lt Major&gt</b>.<b>&lt Minor&gt</b>.<b>&lt Patch&gt</b>-<b>&lt Release&gt</b>-<b>&lt Platform&gt</b>.<b>&lt Extension&gt</b>
<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>- 'Major'</span>
is the number of the SDK main release for reached major milestones<br>-&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">'Minor'</span> for reached minor milestones<br>-&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">'Patch' </span>multiple bugfixes or medium size changes<br>-&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">'Release'</span> is mainly for minor bug fixes or changes<br>-&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">'Platform' </span>Platform the SDK is for, for example 'Windows' for a Windows version of the SDK<br>-&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">'Extension' </span>is the file extension, for example 'exe' for a Windows version of the SDK<br><br>

We strongly recommend to NOT use 'nightly build'-versions&nbsp;within a productive environment because they may be instable. This, usually automatically, build versions have a 'nightly' within the SDK name.<br>
